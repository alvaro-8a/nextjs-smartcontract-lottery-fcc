<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Check the website [here](https://alvaro-8a-decentralizedlottery.on.fleek.co/)**

All the code was developed for learning purposes and is from [Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript – 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&lis) by freeCodeCamp.org and Patrick Collins

The project represents a Web3 to interact a smart contract for a fair raffle system. People can enter the raffle by paying 0.01 ETH.

After some players have enter the raffle, if the raffle is OPEN and the has passed enough time, the smart contract automatically will pick a winner and will send the pool prize to the winner. 

Once the winner is picked, the raffle resets the players list and the process starts from the begining
